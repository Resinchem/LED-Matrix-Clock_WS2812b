![all_modes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55962781/113493423-2a029f00-94ad-11eb-8f39-43af33dc5daa.jpg)

Updated version of the original 3D LED Clock, countdown timer, scoreboard and new text display mode, using 400 WS2811b pixels.

## Key Features:
* Multiple large number 'fonts': original 7-segment, modern or hybrid
* Temperature can display indoor or outdoor temperature (via MQTT/External service) in F or C
* Scoreboard supports 3 character "team names" (e.g. DET, BOS, IND, - or any 3 characters you define).
* User controllable colors for all display modes
* Text display supports almost all ASCII characters from 32-122 (except for a couple reserved characters)
* Text display effects, including flash, flash alternate, fade in/out, appear/appear flash and rainbow
* Control via 30+ MQTT commands, local buttons or built-in web browser

(While basic functionality can be controlled via local buttons or the built-in web server, most of the advanced features including the text display mode requires a properly configured MQTT broker).
