# MQTT Topic Commands and States

### MQTT use is technically optional, but many features (such as text mode) can only be used via MQTT

See the [MQTT page](https://github.com/Resinchem/LED-Matrix-Clock_WS2812b/wiki/MQTT-%5C---Home-Assistant-Integration) of the wiki for additional information.

The full list of topic states and commands, and valid payloads, can be found in the MQTT_Topics.pdf file.  Currently, there are over 40 states reported by the clock and over 30 commands that can be issued to the clock over MQTT.
