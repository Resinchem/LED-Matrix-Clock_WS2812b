# MQTT Topic Commands and States

### MQTT use is technically optional, but many features can only be used via MQTT

See the MQTT PAGE of the wiki for additional information.

The full list of topic states and commands, and valid payloads, can be found in the MQTT_Topics.pdf file.  Currently, there are over 30 states reported by the clock and over 20 commands that can be issued to the clock over MQTT.
